# Execution state

**Restart point.**
1. Run `bash scripts/dev/setup-node.sh`, or put `/opt/nvm/versions/node/v24.22.1/bin` first on PATH.
2. Read this file.
3. Continue with the first package under **Next**.

## Done (verified in CI)
- **Baseline re-measured:** see `BASELINE.md`.
- **Workspace and reconciliation:** this folder; `scripts/status.ts` generates `CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md`.
- **FW, the operation framework** (DECISION-LOG D-6; CI to confirm on the commit that adds it):
  - six output formats, fuzzed against four independent decoders;
  - `--filter-output`, `--token-limit` and `--llms`;
  - stateless paging (`src/ops/page.ts`);
  - the response budget and `result_too_large`.
  - Rows tagged: RX-1/output-formats, RX-1/paging, REA-C35, LEAN-C10.
  - `scripts/oracle.ts` moves to NAT-1, the first package with a new answer key.

## Active
- **NAT-1, strings and bytes:** `read.strings`, `read.bytes`, `search.bytes`, and the answer key
  from `llvm-strings` through `scripts/oracle.ts`.

## Next (in order)
1. NAT-2, layout and entropy.
2. NAT-3, symbols and procedures.
3. NAT-4, format depth.
4. ARC, archives and bundles.
5. SBX, the sandbox.
6. DMN, the daemon and MCP.

## Blocked
- **The automatic session hook:** refused by the session's permission policy (DECISION-LOG D-5).
  The setup script stands in for it.

## Known defects
- None open beyond the ledgers' weak points.
